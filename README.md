TXAdapter
=========

Standalone adapter translating CPPM signals to Hubsan and FlySky signals. Requires an a7105 transceiver and an Arduino Pro Mini or similar preferably at 3.3V. Pinouts are defined in config.h. Uses the Arduino development environment. Derived from Deviation work by PhracturedBlue and others.

Developed for my own use but may be of interest to others.
